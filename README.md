Installation
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd your-project
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): python -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment:
For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux: source env/bin/activate
Install the project dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the project for data analysis and categorizing data using text classification, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format for text classification, such as CSV or JSON.
Preprocess the data: Implement data preprocessing techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, or stop word removal, as necessary.
Train a text classification model: Select a machine learning algorithm or technique from the available options and train a model on your dataset.
Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data and categorize it accordingly.
Iterate and improve: Experiment with different algorithms, techniques, or feature engineering approaches to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the text classification.
Example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(
    data['text'], data['category'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Preprocess the text data
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
train_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)
test_features = vectorizer.transform(test_data)

# Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
classifier = SVC()
classifier.fit(train_features, train_labels)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = classifier.score(test_features, test_labels)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
